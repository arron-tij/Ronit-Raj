# Ronit-Raj

A backend framework created to display a list of all image galleries. I haven't focussed much on the UI and have created only a basic template.

## How to run the webpage?
1) Fork and unzip the repository in a folder named:  gallery_list 
2) Run the command prompt on Windows and move to the above said directory(gallery_list)
3) Type and run the command:  py manage.py runserver
4) Open a web browser and run the link http://127.0.0.1:8000/galleries/
